## Test

### Bézier curve
$$b_0^n(t)=\sum_{j=0}^{n}b_jB_j^n(t)$$

### Casteljau’s algorithm

$$B_j^n(t)=\binom{n}{j}t^j(1-t)^{n-j}$$

## JavaScript

We chose JavaScript for it's simplicity, its ability to run anywhere without worrying about installation and configuration, and its easy canvas tool used for displaying graphical content.

## Run

Open the `index.html` file.
